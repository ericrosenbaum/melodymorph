I had to change the linking on Mac as I got errors from the curl rules header
file which was complaining about sizes of longs etc.. This was I compiled a 
64bit version instead of i386. I created two flavous so you have to link against
the correct one (probably the llvm-gcci386 version.

I used this to compile curl from sources: (See also:compile_mac_7_21_6.sh)
=============================================================================
#!/bin/sh
set -x
dir=${PWD}
bd=${dir}/build
if [ ! -d ${db} ] ; then
        mkdir -p ${bd}
fi

export CC="/Developer/usr/bin/llvm-gcc-4.2"
./configure     --disable-ldap \
                --without-ssl \
                --prefix=${bd} \
                --enable-static \
                --disable-ldaps \
                CFLAGS="-arch i386"
make
make install

This addon was created using curl-7.21.1 downloaded from:
http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.21.1.tar.gz

Compiling libcurl from source on windows
================================================================================
- Download source
- Extract and open a 'cmd' window, go to the directory
- I used a recent (2010.09.26) version of mingw and typed:

mingw32-make mingw32

  to create a basic libcurl library. Then I used the static
  libcurl.a from the created "lib" directory to link against 
  in my project (code::blocks, windows).

- These are the directories you get when you download libcurl
include - use this for libcurl
lib 	- use this for libcurl
src	- this is the curl application.


Compiling libcurl from source on Mac (for the addon)
================================================================================
Download libcurl form here: 
http://www.hmug.org/pub/MacOS_X/BSD/Applications/Internet/curl/

./configure --disable-ldab --without-ssl --prefix=/Downloads/curl-7.21.1/stage CFLAGS="-arch i386" 

make
make install

Then I'm compiling a 10.6, i386 architecture project in XCode.

Install (both WIN / MAC)
================================================================================
Use these preprocessor defines:	
	OFXCURL_WITH_OFXCOMMANDPATTERN
	CURL_STATIC
		
Install MAC (both WIN / MAC)
================================================================================
Add this search path:
	../../../addons_diederick/ofxCurl/lib/mac/

		

IMPORTANT:
================================================================================
In Code::Blocks I had to define these two defines to make it 
link:

CURL_STATICLIB
CURL_DISABLE_LDAP

I also changed the curl-7.21.1\lib\config-win32.h file and added this define
at the top:
#define CURL_DISABLE_LDAP

Note to myself
================================================================================
* need to write some how-to for CodeBlocks windows.
* C::B add these search paths:
..\..\..\addons\ofxCurl\src\include_codeblocks\
..\..\..\addons\ofxCurl\src\
* C::B add these linker setting (position it above ws2_32 as it needs WSA* functions)
..\..\..\addons\ofxCurl\lib\win\libcurl.a
* Add these defines (Compiler Settings > Defines)
CURL_STATICLIB
CURL_DISABLE_LDAP
